# SSH Bruteforcer
Simple SSH Bruteforcer using Paramiko in Python 3.

# Combinations
There is currently only a few combinations for passwords like `ubnt` and `ubnt` but you can of course add your own ones.

# Target servers
My solution for finding SSH servers was using the shodan API but of course some people might have a list of servers they want to target so there is support for that as well.
